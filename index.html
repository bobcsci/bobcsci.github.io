# Abstraction    
      
Abstraction allows us to represent the essential features of an object while hiding unnecessary details. <br/><br/>
      Abstraction enables us to focus on what an object does (its behavior) rather than how it does it (its implementation). 
      
# Instantiation 
      
Instantiation refers to the process of creating an instance or an object of a class. <br/>
When you define a class, you are essentially creating a blueprint or a template for objects. <br/>
An instance is a concrete realization of that blueprint, <br/>which means it is an actual object that can be used in your program.

# Encapsulation

# Encapsulation    
Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions or behaviors) that operate on that data within a single unit called an "object." <br/>
      The main idea behind encapsulation is to hide the internal implementation details of an object from the outside world while providing well-defined interfaces through which other objects can interact with it.
<br/><br/>
In encapsulation, the internal state of an object (its data or attributes) is made private or protected, meaning it cannot be accessed directly from outside the object. <br/>
      Instead, access to the object's state is provided through public methods (getter and setter methods) that enforce controlled access and ensure data integrity.

# Inheritance
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows one class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. <br/>
The class that inherits from another class is called the subclass or derived class, and the class from which it inherits is called the superclass or base class.
<br/><br/>
Inheritance is used to model an "is-a" relationship between classes. <br/>
It allows you to create a hierarchy of classes where subclasses can reuse and extend the functionality of their superclass, promoting code reusability and making the code more organized and maintainable.

<br/><br/>     
<h3> Examples:</h3> 
<ul>
      <li> Animal vs. Cat</li> 
      <li> Animal vs. Dog</li> 
      <li> Student vs. UniversityStudent</li>
      <li> Table vs. DiningTable</li>
</ul>

# Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. <br/>
      It enables a single interface to represent multiple related behaviors or methods, allowing code to be more flexible, reusable, and extensible.
<br/><br/>
Polymorphism in OOP can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading. (More in next session)<br/><br/>
Key takeaway: Allow different sub-classes redefine different behaviour for the same function.
